# BowlerScores

This code will analyze a txt file, which includes the names of 10 bowlers along with 5 scores. This program takes the names of the bowlers one by one and calculates the average score based on the 5 scores provided. If the program can't open the file then it'll print out that file was not found. Otherwise it'll print out the names of the bowlers one by one, along with the list of their scores and average score beside it.
